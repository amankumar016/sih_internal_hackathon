# GUARD Smart Tourist Safety Platform - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Reference-Based (Hybrid Modern Safety Platform)
Drawing inspiration from emergency response platforms like Citizen, travel safety apps like TravelSafe, and modern dashboards like Linear/Notion, while maintaining accessibility and trust-building design patterns.

## Core Design Principles
- **Trust & Authority**: Professional, reliable visual language that instills confidence
- **Emergency Accessibility**: Clear visual hierarchy with emergency elements prominently displayed
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Design that respects Indian cultural context and multilingual needs
- **Real-time Clarity**: Clear status indicators and live data visualization

## Color Palette

- **Trust Blue**: 220 75% 45% (navigation, secondary actions, data visualization)
- **Success Green**: 140 65% 50% (safety indicators, positive status)

### Supporting Colors
