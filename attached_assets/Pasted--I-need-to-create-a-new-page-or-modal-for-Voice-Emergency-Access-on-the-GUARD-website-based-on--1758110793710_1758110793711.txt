"I need to create a new page or modal for 'Voice Emergency Access' on the 'GUARD' website, based on the provided UI screenshots.

Part 1: HTML Structure (index.html - or a new HTML file if it's a separate page/modal)

Main Container: Create a central container for the entire feature. This container should be centered horizontally on the page and have the global 'Glassmorphism' card style (semi-transparent white background, blur, thin white border, soft shadow, rounded corners).

Set the main title: <h1>Voice Emergency Access</h1>

Add a tagline below it: <p>Speak your emergency in any language</p>

'Select Language' Section:

Inside the main container, create another div for language selection, also applying the 'Glassmorphism' card style.

Add a heading: <h3><span style="font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'; font-weight: 900;">&#xf12d;</span> Select Language</h3> (using a mock icon for 'translate' or 'language').

Create a grid or row of buttons for languages.

English: Primary Blue button style (#4F46E5 background, white text, 8px rounded corners).

Hindi (हिन्दी): Secondary style (white background, Neutral-600 text, Neutral-200 border, 8px rounded corners).

Assamese (অসমীয়া): Secondary style.

Bengali (বাংলা): Secondary style.

Gujarati (ગુજરાતી): Secondary style.

Tamil (தமிழ்): Secondary style.

(Optional: If there's space, add more languages from the full list provided previously, using the secondary button style).

'Voice Input' Section:

Below the language section, create another div for voice input, again with the 'Glassmorphism' card style.

Add a heading: <h3>Voice Input</h3>

Microphone Button: Create a large, circular, purple button in the center of this section.

It should contain a microphone icon (<span style="font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'; font-weight: 900;">&#xf130;</span> or similar).

Add text below it: Tap to speak.

Action Buttons: Below the microphone button, add two full-width buttons:

'Send Voice Emergency': Use the Danger Red (#DC2626) button style, white text, 8px rounded corners. Include a phone icon (<span style="font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'; font-weight: 900;">&#xf095;</span>).

'Call Emergency Helpline': Use the secondary button style (white background, Neutral-600 text, Neutral-200 border, 8px rounded corners).

Offline Note:

Below all the main cards, create a separate div with a Warning Yellow (#FBBF24) background, Neutral-900 text, and 8px rounded corners.

Add bold text: <strong>Note:</strong> This service works offline via SMS when internet is unavailable.

Part 2: CSS Styling (style.css)

Apply Global Styles: Ensure the Glassmorphism effect, button styles (primary, destructive, secondary), typography (Inter), and color palette (Primary Blue, Danger Red, Warning Yellow, Neutral-900, Neutral-600, Neutral-200) are applied consistently to all elements as defined in the global design system prompt.

Layout:

Center the main container horizontally.

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the language buttons to arrange them nicely.

Center the microphone button and its text vertically and horizontally within its section.

Microphone Button: Define a circular shape, purple background, centered icon, and Tap to speak text.

Offline Note: Style the div with the yellow background and appropriate padding.

Part 3: JavaScript (Optional, script.js)

No explicit functionality is required for this UI mock, but if it's a modal, ensure there's JavaScript to show/hide it when the 'Voice-Text Emergency Access' button is clicked from the login page or tourist view.

Important Instructions for the AI:

Prioritize existing global styles: Reuse CSS classes for buttons, cards, and typography already defined in style.css if possible.

Use appropriate HTML semantics.

Ensure responsiveness: The layout should adapt well to different screen sizes, especially mobile.

For icons, use Font Awesome (or a similar iconic font/SVG system already in use).

Integrate this as a new, standalone HTML file (e.g., voice-emergency.html) if it's a separate page, or as a hidden modal element within index.html if it's meant to pop up. Please specify which approach you're taking."
