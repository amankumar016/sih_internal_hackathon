Part 1: Prompt for "Guardian Gamification" (in the Community Forum)
"Navigate to the HTML file for your Community Forum page. At the top of this page, before the existing list of forum posts, I want you to insert a new, major feature section for 'Guardian Gamification'.

This section should be built using the existing 'Glassmorphism' card styles and will consist of three parts:

A. Main Progress & Leaderboard Section:

Header: Add a main <h2> title: Guardian Gamification, with a <p> subtitle: Earn rewards for staying safe and helping others.

Two-Column Layout: Create a two-column layout below the header.

Left Column ('Your Progress'):

Create a 'Glassmorphism' card titled <h3><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Your Progress</h3>.

Inside, display:

Level: Level 8 (large font) with a title below it: Safety Explorer.

Total Points: 15,670 Total Points (aligned to the right).

XP Progress Bar: A progress bar showing 2340 / 2500 towards the next level.

Three Summary Cards: A row of three smaller cards for:

Day Streak: 7

Badges Earned: 5

Global Rank: #4

Right Column ('Leaderboard'):

Create a 'Glassmorphism' card titled <h3><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Leaderboard</h3>.

Inside, create a ranked list of users. Each list item should show a rank, user icon/avatar, name, and points.

Highlight the current user.

Populate with this mock data:

#1 Priya Sharma - 18,450 pts

#2 Amit Kumar - 17,230 pts

#3 Rajesh Singh - 16,890 pts

#4 You - 15,670 pts (highlighted row)

#5 Diksha Patel - 15,120 pts

B. Active Challenges Section:

Below the Progress/Leaderboard section, add a new section titled <h2><i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i> Active Challenges</h2>.

Create a 2x2 grid of 'Glassmorphism' challenge cards. Each card should contain:

An icon and a title (e.g., Daily Check-in Streak).

An XP reward tag (e.g., +500 XP).

A short description (e.g., Check-in daily for 7 days).

A progress bar with a fraction (e.g., Progress 7 / 7).

Create four mock challenges based on the provided image.

C. Achievement Badges Section:

Below the Active Challenges, add a final section titled <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Achievement Badges</h2>.

Create a responsive grid of 'Glassmorphism' badge cards. Each card should contain:

A unique icon for the badge.

The badge title (e.g., Safety Scout).

A short description of how to earn it (e.g., Report 5 safety observations).

A status tag, such as Earned.

Create at least 8 mock badges based on the image, showing some as 'Earned' and others as locked/not yet earned for realism."

Part 2: Prompt for "Today's Safety Tips" (on the Tourist Dashboard)
"Now, navigate to the HTML file for your main Tourist Dashboard page.

Find the Location: Locate the header element that contains the <h1>Tourist Dashboard</h1> and its subtitle (Currently in: Shillong, Meghalaya).

Insert the Component: Directly below this header, in the empty space, insert the following component.

Card Structure:

Create a 'Glassmorphism' card.

Inside the card, add a header with a shield icon and the title: <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Today's Safety Tips</h2>.

Below the title, add a bulleted list (<ul>) with the following mock safety tips:

Weather is clear - perfect for sightseeing

Carry extra water for high altitude areas in Meghalaya

Keep emergency contacts updated on your profile

Stay with your group at all times, especially in crowded markets

Remember today is Wednesday, September 17th. Some local shops may close early.

Please ensure all new components are responsive and use the existing site-wide styles for fonts, colors, and cards."
