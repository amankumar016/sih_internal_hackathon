I need to create a new section for the saarthi.html page titled 'How Saarthi Learns'. This section must be visually identical to the provided screenshot and, most importantly, must be populated with realistic and dynamic-looking mock data.

Please follow these instructions precisely.

Part 1: Section Header and Layout
Create the Section Container: Add a new, full-width section to the Saarthi page.

Add the Header:

Start with an <h2> title: <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> How Saarthi Learns. (Use a Font Awesome cloud icon).

Add a <p> subtitle below it: Real-time data integration from multiple verified sources ensures comprehensive safety analysis.

Grid Layout: Inside the section, create a responsive grid that will hold the data source cards. The grid should display 3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile.

Part 2: Data Source Card Structure (The Template)
For each item in the grid, create a 'Glassmorphism' card with the following internal structure. This will be the template for all data source cards.

Top Row (Flexbox, space-between):

Left Side: A div containing an icon and the card's title (e.g., <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> <h4>Police & NCRB Data</h4>).

Right Side: A <span> for the status tag (e.g., <span class="status-tag active">active</span>).

Middle Section:

A div containing the 'Reliability' label and the percentage value, aligned to opposite ends (e.g., <p>Reliability</p> <p class="reliability-percent">98%</p>).

A horizontal progress bar element below it (e.g., <div class="progress-bar-container"><div class="progress-bar-fill"></div></div>).

Bottom Row:

A small, light-grey paragraph for the last update timestamp (e.g., <p class="timestamp">Updated 2 min ago</p>).

Part 3: Populate with Realistic Mock Data
Now, create six cards using the template above, and populate them with the following specific, varied data to make the dashboard look live and authentic.

Card 1:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-shield-alt (shield)

Title: Police & NCRB Data

Status Tag: active (Green background)

Reliability: 98%

Timestamp: Updated 2 min ago

Card 2:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-newspaper

Title: Local & Regional News

Status Tag: active (Green background)

Reliability: 85%

Timestamp: Updated 5 min ago

Card 3:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-cloud-sun-rain (weather)

Title: IMD Weather Alerts

Status Tag: syncing (Yellow background)

Reliability: 96%

Timestamp: Updated 1 min ago

Card 4:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-users

Title: Social Media Trends

Status Tag: active (Green background)

Reliability: 72%

Timestamp: Updated 30 sec ago

Card 5:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-wifi

Title: Network Data

Status Tag: active (Green background)

Reliability: 91%

Timestamp: Updated 45 sec ago

Card 6:

Icon: Font Awesome fa-mobile-alt (mobile phone)

Title: Device Telemetry

Status Tag: active (Green background)

Reliability: 99%

Timestamp: Updated 10 sec ago

Part 4: CSS Styling
Card Style: Apply the global 'Glassmorphism' style to all six cards.

Status Tags:

Style the .active class with a green background and dark text.

Style the .syncing class with a yellow background and dark text.

Give the tags rounded corners and padding.

Progress Bars:

Style the progress bar container with a light grey background.

Style the inner fill div with a red background, as shown in the image.

Use JavaScript to set the width of the inner fill div to match the reliability percentage for each card (e.g., width: 98%;).

Responsiveness: Ensure the grid layout adjusts correctly on smaller screens."
