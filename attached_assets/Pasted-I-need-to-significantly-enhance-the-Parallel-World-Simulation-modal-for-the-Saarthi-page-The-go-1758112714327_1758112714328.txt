I need to significantly enhance the 'Parallel World Simulation' modal for the 'Saarthi' page. The goal is to create a dynamic, visually engaging, and highly interactive simulation within this modal, going beyond a simple static preview. It must fully leverage the 'Glassmorphism' design system and include real-time animation.

Focus on the following details for the modal's design and functionality:

Part 1: Core Modal Structure & Enhanced 'Glassmorphism' UI
Modal Container:

Create a div for the modal (#parallel-world-modal) that is hidden by default.

Apply the full 'Glassmorphism' style (semi-transparent background, blur, thin white border, soft shadow, rounded corners) to the modal itself, ensuring it looks premium and floats above the main page.

Header: <h3>Parallel World Simulation</h3> with a prominent 'Close' button (an 'X' icon, styled to be easily clickable).

Internal Layout:

Inside the modal, create a responsive two-column layout. The left column will be the dynamic map, and the right column will be the simulation analysis. Both columns should visually integrate seamlessly into the 'Glassmorphism' modal.

Part 2: Dynamic & Animated Left Column (The Parallel World Map)
Map Display Area: Dedicate the entire left column of the modal to the 'Parallel World Map'.

Background: Use the same underlying map image you provided (or a suitable placeholder) as a background for this area.

Dynamic Path Animation (Crucial):

Instead of a static Map preview (demo) label, this area will dynamically display an animated path, similar to the simulation on the main Saarthi page.

When 'Start Simulation' is clicked, a brightly colored (e.g., glowing cyan or primary blue) animated line should "draw" itself on the map, mimicking a Saarthi avatar walking a route. The path should be organic, with several turns, reflecting realistic movement.

Saarthi Avatar Marker: As the path draws, a small, subtle Saarthi avatar icon (or a simple glowing dot) should move along the path in real-time.

Looping: The animation should either loop continuously or offer a 'Reset' for a new run.

No 'Map preview (demo)' text should be visible once the simulation starts.

Simulation Controls:

Position the 'Start Simulation' (Primary Blue button style) and 'Stop' (Secondary button style) buttons clearly at the bottom of this left map column.

Part 3: Enhanced Right Column (Simulation Analysis)
'Simulation Analysis' Card: Design this right column as a 'Glassmorphism' card integrated into the modal, with the title <h3>Simulation Analysis</h3>.

Dynamic Metrics Display:

Crowd Density:

Display Crowd Density: [Value]%.

Below it, add a horizontal progress bar, dynamically filling based on the value. Use a color gradient (e.g., green to yellow to orange) to visually represent the density level. (e.g., 73% as in the image).

Community Trust: Display Community Trust: [Value]/5 (e.g., 2.6/5).

CCTV: Display CCTV: Detected or Not detected.

Nearest Police Booth: Display Nearest Police Booth: [Value]m (e.g., 392m).

Scrollbar: Ensure the right column has a subtle, custom-styled vertical scrollbar if the content overflows, as shown in the reference image.

Part 4: JavaScript Interactivity
Modal Visibility:

The modal should remain hidden until the "Launch Parallel World Simulation" button (from the main Saarthi page) is clicked.

The 'Close' button within the modal should hide it.

Simulation Control:

'Start Simulation' button:

Triggers the dynamic path and avatar animation in the left column.

Updates the 'Simulation Analysis' metrics in the right column dynamically, simulating changes over time (e.g., Crowd Density increasing, distance changing).

'Stop' button: Pauses or resets the animation and the metrics.

Crucial Instructions for the AI:

Prioritize a high-quality, animated visual experience for the map in the left column of the modal. This is not just a static image.

Ensure the 'Glassmorphism' effect is applied beautifully and consistently throughout the modal for a premium feel.

All data displayed (Crowd Density, Community Trust, etc.) should be mock/simulated data but appear dynamic during the simulation.

Make the entire modal and its content fully responsive."
